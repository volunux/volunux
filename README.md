### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an up and coming software engineer developing web applications in languages primarily including Java and TypeScript using technologies such as Express.js and Spring Boot.

On the frontend, I use Angular framework.
I love developing applications using OOP because it fits nicely with the real world I live in and its problems. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a customer relationship management application.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to get better at Java and JavaScript

- My favorite language is Java and my favorite web application framework is Spring.
- I am very good at Express.js, Nestjs, Angular and Spring with the last three revolving around a concept called Inversion of Control and Dependency Injection.
- I love Servlets too because I started learning it before Spring.
